This repository contains code used for analyses in the paper "Areal Pressure and Grammatical Evolution," to appear in Diachronica 35.

Python scripts are written for Python 2.

infer_rates.py infers evolutionary rates for each feature, outputting a file feature_rates.txt

eval.sh is a shell script which runs each script pertaining to an evaluation metric

analysis.sh runs the simulation procedure for 20 random number seeds, carries out mixed-effects linear regression; finally Fisher's combined probability test is carried out
this script also makes figures and tables from the simulation for random number seed 0

cleantex.py converts characters that are problematic for LaTeX in individual files outputted by various scripts
